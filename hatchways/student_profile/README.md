# Notes
Four tasks of assignment are complete, last one is incomplete(half done). Tags are added but search with tags is not done (tried). As tags are added on client-side, they are not posted to api. Its easier to perform search if tages are added to json(api) but for that we need to use Express server and CORS functionality.
